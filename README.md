# NLP basics workshop 2025
NLP basics workshop for the technion CS faculty hackathon 2025.
The hackathon this year is focused on battling fake news. The workshop is also focused on this topic, but in order to encourage teams to come up with original ideas, we build a terrible app idea - a fake news generator.
The code includes the following steps:
1. Scraping a webpage
2. Summarizing the main topics from it
3. Creating a news item based on one of the extracted topics, but one that contradicts the information in the original item.

Slides for the workshop are available [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pC4K9_zZGH7iatb_d3PFoyhTNI8wykE8GxU6AJWEEc8/edit?usp=sharing).
